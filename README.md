# Elevator Pitch

What if you woke up one day and decided you want to impress everyone at the office water cooler?

How would you go about this? You could use Wikipedia! Or maybe YouTube videos suit you better? How about both!?

Introducing CosmosGator, the everything aggregator. 

# Concept

CosmosGator is an everything aggregator. The app allows you to search for a term and displays Wikipedia and YouTube results all in one place! 

# User Story

As a curious human being, I want to learn interesting information about anything and everything in the cosmos, so that I can be the coolest person at the office water cooler!
