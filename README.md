## User Story

As a curious human being, I want to learn interesting information about anything and everything in the cosmos, so that I can be a popular person at the next office party!

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when:

- Nadeem, John and Monrone can clearly articulate the project idea

- The application uses Bootstrap

- The application has a polished UI
    - The user is presented with a Modal to search a Cosmos related term
    - Below the Modal hashtags with suggested search terms show. Clicking one of the search terms populates the Modal with this term 
    - The user is then presented with an image related to their search term (NASA API) and a few paragraphs of text related to their search term (Wikimedia API)

- The application is responsive (adapts to various screen sizes)

- The application uses Bootstrap Modals in place of alerts, confirms or prompts 

- The application implements two server-side APIs:
    - NASA
    - Wikimedia (Wikipedia)

- The application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input)

- The application uses client-side storage to store persistent data 

- The application is deployed to Github pages
    - The application loads with no errors

- The repository meets quality coding standards:
    - The Github contributions from Nadeem, John and Monrone are evenly balanced
    - Repository has a unique name

    - Demo: Show your stuff!
    - Directions for Future Development
    - Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

- The deployed application URL has been submitted on Bootcamp Spot
